    Module description:
    
    This program contains a collection of 4 functions:
    last_multiple(), censor(), transform(), and decimal_to_hexadecimal().
    Each accomplishes its own task, which is described in the block
    comment that precedes it. Each comment block also lists test cases
    that the function should pass.

"""   
    The last_multiple() function takes 2 parameters, m and n, which are
    assumed to be positive integers. It returns the largest multiple of
    m that is less than or equal to n.

    Test cases:

    last_multiple(1, 5) should return 5
    last_multiple(3, 9) should return 9
    last_multiple(3, 10) should return 9
    last_multiple(7, 20) should return 14

"""
    The censor() function obscures 4-letter words in a string.
    The function has one parameter, in_string, which is assumed to be
    a string. All 4-letter words in the string are replaced by **** and
    the resulting string is returned. Words may include numbers and
    non-alphanumeric characters.

    Test cases:

    censor("I like my cat.") should return 'I **** my ****'
    censor("my book is here") should return 'my **** is ****'
    censor("No bad words here.") should return 'No bad words here.'
    censor("%%%% 2j*#n") should return '**** 2j*#n'

"""
    The transform() function transforms a given phrase into a coded
    sequence that is determined by shifting each letter in the phrase
    by a constant amount in the alphabet. The shift preserves
    capitalization and is done in a circular manner so that the letter
    after "z" is "a" and the letter after "Z" is "A". The transformed
    phrase is returned.

    The input phrase is assumed to be a string of letters and spaces,
    and the shift amount is assumed to be an integer.

    Test cases:

    transform("a", 0) should return 'a'
    transform("abc xyz", 1) should return 'bcd yza'
    transform("ABC XYZ", 2) should return 'CDE ZAB'
    transform("AbC xYz", -1) should return 'ZaB wXy
    transform("I love bagels", 20) should return 'C fipy vuayfm'
    transform("iemawum", 200) should return 'awesome'

"""
    The decimal_to_hexadeimal() function performs a decimal (base-10)
    to hexadecimal (base-16) conversion. It takes one parameter, which
    is called value. The input is assumed to be a nonnegative integer
    that is expressed in decimal notation. It returns the hexadecimal
    representation of the input as a string that is prefixed by the
    convention "0x".

    The algorithm reduces the specified value by converting
    the remainder of its division by 16 to one of the following symbols:
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, or F.
    The quotient is then divided by 16 and a symbol is extracted again
    until the entire value is converted to hexadecimal.

    Test cases:

    decimal_to_hexadecimal(0) should return '0x0'
    decimal_to_hexadecimal(10) should return '0xA'
    decimal_to_hexadecimal(1000) should return '0x3E8'
    decimal_to_hexadecimal(10000) should return '0x2710'
